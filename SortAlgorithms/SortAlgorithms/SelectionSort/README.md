# Selection Sort



## How selection sort works?

1. Initialize minimum value to location 0
2. Traverse the array to find the minimum element in the array
3. While traversing if any element smaller than minimum value is found then swap both the values
4. Then, increment minimum value to point to the next element
5. Repeat until the array is sorted

# Insertion Sort

A good way to understand insertion sort is to imagine that you are playing a cards game where the dealer gives you a card at a time and you like to order them in your hand.

## How quick sort works?

1. It saves the new item in a new variable
2. Shift all elements greater than the new item to the right
3. Insert the new item in the empty index
